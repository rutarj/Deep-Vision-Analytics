# DeepVisionAnalytics

CVI620 (Computer Vision) 
A Computer Vision Exploration

Welcome to the DeepVisionAnalytics repository! This project is part of a focused learning fundamental concepts in Deep learning and Image processing through hands-on coding and experimentation. The repository contains various examples, exercises, and a final project that demonstrates computer vision applications such as face recognition, object tracking, medical imaging, and more.

Course Overview
As digital images and videos become a prominent part of modern computing, understanding how to process and extract meaningful information from visual data is crucial. In this course, we explore:

Capturing and processing digital images and videos
Applying basic image manipulations (e.g., crop, rotate, enhance)
Extracting information from images (e.g., detecting or counting objects)
Object tracking in video sequences
Applying these techniques to real-world computer vision applications (e.g., face recognition, security systems, medical imaging, robotics)
